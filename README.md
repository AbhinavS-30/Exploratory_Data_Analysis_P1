# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Project 1

## Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing ultra-marathon race records. The primary goal is to filter and analyze USA-based 50km and 50-mile races held in 2020 to understand participation trends and performance.

## Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name**: `TWO_CENTURIES_OF_UM_RACES.csv`
- **Size**: ~789 MB (not included in the repository)
- **Source**: Historical ultra-marathon race results (Kaggle)
- **Link to Dataset**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633

Note: The dataset is not included in the repository due to GitHub’s file size limitations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for analysis and visualization)

## Code Structure
- `Untitled1.ipynb` → Contains the EDA process, including data filtering, visualization, and insights.

## Future Enhancements
- Conduct detailed statistical analysis on ultra-marathon performance metrics.
- Implement machine learning models to predict finishing times.
- Build an interactive dashboard for real-time race data analysis.
